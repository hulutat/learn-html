<p>Along with the Inca Trail and Kilimanjaro expedition, the  Everest Base Camp Trek is one of the most popular treks in the world. No doubt  it should be included in your bucket list. <br>
  <a href="https://www.adventuregreathimalaya.com/everest-base-camp-trek/"><strong><em>EBC  trek</em></strong></a> is two weeks plus teahouse trek in Nepal which follows the  foot print of legendry mountaineers and takes you to lap of mighty Everest. <br>
  The Everest Base Camp Trekking Trip initiates with an  overnight stop in the vibrant city of Kathmandu (the capital of Nepal). The  next day begins with an adventurous flight to Lukla, the major gateway to  Everest. It takes around 10 – 12 days to reach Base Camp and Kalapatthar and  trek back to Lukla (it includes two nights halt at Namche Bazaar and Dingboche  for acclimatization). <br>
  Most of trekkers believe that trekking to the BC of world  highest peak via rough mountain terrain is treacherous. But it is not that  challenging; with proper preparation and training, you can complete the trek  without being the victim of mountain threats. <br>
  Here are some of the difficulties of Everest Base Camp Trek,  you are likely to encounter during your trip:</p>
<h2>Trekking Route</h2>
<p>The trail route to EBC and back is roughly 130km (80 miles)  (starting from and ending at Lukla). It also includes the side trip for  acclimatization at Namche and Dingboche. It is roughly 65km one way route to  reach BC which takes 8 – 9 days uphill walk and 3 – 4 days of easy downhill  walk back to Lukla. Trekkers have to walk around 6 – 8 hours per day which  covers approximately 6 – 7 miles. For unseasoned trekkers, the lengthy trekking  route might be the difficulty. </p>
<h2>Elevation and Altitude Sickness </h2>
<p>The elevation and its related health threat is another major  difficulty during your <a href="https://www.adventuregreathimalaya.com/everest-base-camp-trek/"><strong><em>hike  to Everest Base Camp</em></strong></a>. The starting point Lukla is at 2,850m and the  final height Kalapatthar is at 5,545m. You will gain 500m – 700m per day during  the trek. If you do not acclimatize and rest properly, it is very hard to  complete the trek successfully.  We  suggest you to stay one more day at Namche and Dingoche followed by the side  trips it offers. </p>
<h2>Weather &amp; Temperature </h2>
<p>The temperature and weather in high mountains are very  unpredictable. It usually drops down to -12 degree Celsius in mid-November.  Though the nights are below freezing level, day remains sunny with clear blue  sky and excellent views. It is for high season – autumn and spring. If you are  well-prepared with proper gear, temperature might not be come in your  difficulty list. </p>
<h2>Flight Cancellation and Teahouse  availability </h2>
<p>As we know the weather of mountains are highly  unpredictable, the flights to Lukla are prone to get delayed that may last for  few hours or even for few days. Better to get few spare days to compensate such  delays and cancelation. <br>
  As EBC hiking is popular mountain trek, there are large  flock of trekkers visiting the area in high seasons. The teahouse numbers are limited  at higher altitude which might create difficulty; if you are travelling without  booking the accommodation in advance. </p>
<p>We suggest you to engage in physical training few months prior the trip. Cardio vascular exercise, weight training, running, swimming etc. are best exercise to boost<a name="_GoBack"></a> your strength and endurance capability.</p>
